# AI-Based Solutions for UN Sustainable Development Goals

## Project Overview
This project was developed during the DevFest 2024 hackathon, organized by the Google Developer Group On Campus University of Belgrade as part of a collaborative effort by a team of four, focusing on AI-based solutions addressing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The application leverages modern web technologies to provide meaningful insights and solutions for global challenges.

The web application has two types of users: seniors and helpers. The idea is to assist elderly individuals who live alone and struggle with daily tasks by allowing them to request desired services (e.g. grocery shopping, house cleaning, transportation to a doctorâ€™s appointment, medication pickup, pet walking, etc.) through short message exchanges with an AI assistant. Helpers can then browse a list of available service requests and choose the ones that best fit their schedule, skills, and capabilities. This way, they can assist seniors while also earning money. This improves the quality of life for senior citizens while also providing younger people with an opportunity to earn money.
